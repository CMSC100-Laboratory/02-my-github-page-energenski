I may not have been able to create the GitHub page properly (I might have pushed something wrong) but I do know that:<br>
1. Push an index.html in the repo<br>
2. Make the repo public<br>
3. Configure source for Pages<br>
4. Wait until GitHub Pages gives me a live link for the page<br><br>

My key takeaways from this exercise was to be cautious of what I commit to. I should try to double and triple check what I do so that I would not do this wrongly again. And, laboratory classes are essential because some of us really need guidance on these things.
