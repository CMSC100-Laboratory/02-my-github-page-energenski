I may not have been able to create the GitHub page properly (Edit: I have made it sir :3) but I do know that:<br>
1. Push an index.html in the repo<br>
2. Make the repo public<br>
3. Configure source for Pages<br>
4. Wait until GitHub Pages gives me a live link for the page<br><br>

Apparently, I just needed to push the file one by one into the main since it got pushed only to the .github directory and needed to wait for a few minutes to see my progress.<br><br>

My key takeaways from this exercise was to be cautious of what and where I commit and push and have more patience because change doesn't show immediately.
